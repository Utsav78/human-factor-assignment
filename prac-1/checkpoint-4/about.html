            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am an international student in Australia pursuing a master's in Information 
                Technology, focusing on Software engineering. With two years of self-taught mobile 
                app development experience, I have developed projects like a Hostel Booking 
                System and a Folk Musical Instrument Detection model. I am seeking a career at 
                Capgemini while improving my conversational English and note-taking skills in 
                Obsidian. Currently, I am developing an iOS app for book summaries.
